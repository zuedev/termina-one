# Sellables

A _"sellable"_ is any deliverable that we offer to our customers. Sellables can be categorized into the following types:

1. **Products**: Tangible items that are sold to customers.
2. **Solutions**: Comprehensive offerings that address specific customer needs.
3. [**Services**](./services/): Intangible activities performed for customers.
4. **Platforms**: Foundational systems (usually software-based and self-service) that enable customers to interact with our offerings and build their own solutions.

Each sellable type has its own characteristics and value propositions, allowing us to cater to a diverse range of customer requirements.

For more detailed information on each sellable type, please refer to the respective documentation sections.
